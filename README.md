waterBlob
=========

Mouse water blob click effect - written as jQuery plugin

With a click on the screen you will have a click blob effect like when you touch the water.

All what you have to do is to include the js file in your code:

``` html 
  <script src="/js/$waterBlob.js"></script>
```

Note: it will only work when the client browser supports the canvas element. There is no fallback.
